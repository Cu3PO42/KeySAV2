KeySAV 2.0

3DS X/Y SaveFile Box / Battle Video PKX cracking program.

KeySAV is a tool I wrote to decrypt portions of the X/Y title/extdata from a Digital Save / PowerSaves rip. 
With this tool you can view IVs/Nature/ESV/TSV of Hatched/Unhatched Pok√©mon that are in your boxes or battle videos, so long as you set everything up properly.

SUPPORTS BOTH RETAIL CARTRIDGES AND DIGITAL COPIES
